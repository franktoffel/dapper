# Enforcing individual core usage.
#########################################

#   compared to manual parallelization over independent experiments,
#   ensemble forecasts simulations, or local analyses.
# Therefore: force numpy to only use a single core.
# Unfortunately: this is platform-dependent
#   => you might have to adapt the code to your platform.

# Multiprocessing
#########################################

# Multiprocessing requries pickling. The package 'dill' is able to
# pickle much more than basic pickle (e.g. nested functions),
# and is being used by 'multiprocessing_on_dill'.
# Alternatively, the package pathos also enables multiprocessing with dill.

  """
  A parallelized version of:
  result = [func(x, **kwargs) for x in xx]

  Note: unlike reading, writing "in-place" does not work with multiprocessing
  (unless "shared" arrays are used, but this has not been tried out here).

  See example use in mods/QG/core.py.

  Technicalities dealt with:
   - passing kwargs
   - join(), close()

  However, the main achievement of this helper function is to make
  "Ctrl+C", i.e. KeyboardInterruption,
  stop the execution of the program, and do so "gracefully",
  something which is quite tricky to achieve with multiprocessing.
  """

  # The Ctrl-C issue is mainly cosmetic, but an annoying issue. E.g.
  #  - Pressing ctrl-c should terminate execution.
  #  - It should only be necessary to press Ctrl-C once.
  #  - The traceback does not extend beyond the multiprocessing management
  #    (not into the worker codes), and should therefore be cropped before then.
  #
  # NB: Here be fuckin dragons!
  # This solution is mostly based on stackoverflow.com/a/35134329.
  # I don't (fully) understand why the issues arise,
  # nor why my patchwork solution somewhat works.
  #
  # I urge great caution in modifying this code because
  # issue reproduction is difficult (coz behaviour depends on
  # where the execution is currently at when Ctrl-C is pressed)
  # => testing is difficult.
  #
  # Alternative to try: 
  # - Use concurrent.futures, as the bug seems to have been patched there:
  #   https://bugs.python.org/issue9205. However, does this work with dill?
  # - Multithreading: has the advantage of sharing memory,
  #   but was significantly slower than using processes,
  #   testing on DAPPER-relevant.

  # Alternative: Pool(initializer=[ignore sig]).
  # But the following way seems to work better.
