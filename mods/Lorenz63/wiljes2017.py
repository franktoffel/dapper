# - The relevance of the experimental settings is questionable,
#   since the EnKF/NETF are barely able to beat 3D-Var
#   (with a little tuning beyond infl, 3D-Var would probably
#   beat these more sophisticated methods, so what then is 
#   the interest in NETF beating the EnKF in this setting?).
# - Also, note that the EnKF manages "fine" with N=5,
#   while the paper only tests N>15.
# - Finally, note that there is a mismatch between DAPPER's NETF score
#   and the one reported in the paper. However, DAPPER's implementation
#   is not entirely wrong, since it has some skill.
#   Indeed, it is questionable whether it wrong at all.
