# Concerning the paper's first experiment (also Lorenz'63), reported in fig 2:
# In contrast to the above experiment, this one is not a filtering problem,
# but an initial condition (IC) problem (Q=0 is assumed).
# However, the IC they estimate is [1,1,1], which is OFF the attractor,
# and takes T=1 to get to the attractor.
# Meanwhile they're observing this mellow "run-way",
# which should give very precise information about the IC.
# There is no comparison to the EnKF or any other standard/baseline method.
