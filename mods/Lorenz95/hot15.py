# DAPPER only has localization implemented for the ETKF (LETKF) and the serial EAKF (SL_EAKF).
# Thus, direction comparison to paper (which always uses localization) is difficult.
# Still, these LETKF scores can be compared with Fig. 2 of the paper,
# They indicate that the LETKF is a little better than any scheme in the paper.
# However, lhe localization implementation is probably not fully equivalent
# (also, since optimal R seems to be around 6, I think Hoteit et al may have
# forgotten the sqrt(10/3) factor from Whitaker/Hamill).
#                                                                # Expected RMSE_a:
# cfgs += LETKF(        N=10,rot=True,infl=1.02,loc_rad=4)       # 0.21
# cfgs += LETKF(        N=10,rot=True,infl=1.04,loc_rad=6)       # 0.20
# cfgs += LETKF(        N=10,rot=True,infl=1.10,loc_rad=10)      # 0.22
# cfgs += LETKF(        N=10,         infl=1.20,loc_rad=15)      # 0.29


# Without localization, DAPPER can also compare ESOPS to many other schemes:
# cfgs += EnKF ('Sqrt'           , N=28, infl=1.02,rot=True)     # 0.18
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial'         , N=28, infl=1.02,rot=True)     # 0.18
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial ESOPS'   , N=28, infl=1.02)              # 0.18
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial Stoch'   , N=28, infl=1.08)              # 0.24
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial Var1'    , N=28, infl=1.08)              # 0.24
# cfgs += EnKF ('PertObs'        , N=28, infl=1.08)              # 0.24
# As can be seen, ESOPS does well for a medium-large ensemble,
# getting RMSE scores on the level of the ETKF (i.e. 'Sqrt').
# For a small ensemble, however, ESOPS does not do quiet as well as the ETKF
# (and requires higher inflation to avoid divergence):
# cfgs += EnKF ('Sqrt'           , N=17, infl=1.03)              # 0.217
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial'         , N=17, infl=1.06)              # 0.225
# cfgs += EnKF ('Serial ESOPS'   , N=17, infl=1.08)              # 0.242
