# cfgs += LETKF(N=80,rot=True,infl=1.04       ,loc_rad=5) # 0.43
# These scores are quite variable:
# cfgs += LNETF(N=40,rot=True,infl=1.10,Rs=2.5,loc_rad=5) # 0.57
# cfgs += LNETF(N=80,rot=True,infl=1.10,Rs=1.6,loc_rad=5) # 0.45

# In addition to standard post-analysis inflation,
# we also find the necessity of tuning the inflation (Rs) for R,
# which is not mentioned in the reference.

# In summary, compared to the reference paper:
# - Our rmse scores for the local ETKF are better
# - Our rmse scores for the local NETF
#   - with N=80 seems to be equal
#   - with N=40 is worse
# 
# These results (contradict and) pretty much void the merit of the NETF,
# especially considering how the Laplace obs-error favours the NETF.
# A possible explanation is that they use T=100 (unit-less),
# which is way too short, and so they might have gotten "lucky".
# Another explanation is that our implementation is buggy,
# but this seems unlikely, especially since we reproduce the NETF
# results from Wiljes'2017.
