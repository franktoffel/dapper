# Lorenz95 is highly sensitive to large gradients.
# Therefore, if we only observe every 4th (e.g.) state component,
# the members might "blow up" during the forecast,
# because the assimilation created large gradients.
# (Of course, this will depend on R and dtObs).
# Therefore, the HMM below instead uses "global obs",
# where each observation captures information about the entire state vector.
# The idea is that we can then remove observations, (rows of H)
# one-by-one, to a much larger degree than for H = Identity.

# Ideally, we want the observations to be independent,
# and possibly of the same magnitude
# (i.e. we that the rows of H be orthonormal).
# Furthermore, we want that each observation gives equal weight
# ("consideration") to each state component.
# This can be shown to be equivalent to requiring that the state
# component is equally resolved by each observation,
# and moreover, that the magnitude (abs) of each element of H
# be a constant (1/sqrt(Nx)).

# Can such an H be constructed/found?
# In the 2d case: H = [1, 1; 1, -1] / sqrt(2).
# In the 3d case: no, as can be shown by enumeration.
# (note, however, how easy my geometric intuition was fooled.
# Try rotating the 3-dim stensil.
# Intuitively I thought that it would yield the 3d H of +/- 1's).
# ...
# In fact, only in the 2^n - dimensional case is it possible
# (our conjecture: Madleine/Patrick, based on analogy with the FFT).
#
# Another idea is then to evaluate the value of 40 orthogonal basis
# functions at 40 equidistant locations
# (corresponding to the indices of Lorenz95).
# This will not yield a matrix of +/- 1's,
# but should nevertheless give nicely distributed weights.

# Note that the legendre polynomials are not orthogonal when
# (the inner product is) evaluated on discrete, equidistant points.
# Moreover, the actual orthogonal polynomial basis
# (which I think goes under the name of Gram polynomials, and can be
# constructed by qr-decomp (gram-schmidt) of a 40-dim Vandermonde matrix).
# would in fact not be a good idea:
# it is well-known that not only will the qr-decomp be numerically unstable,
# the exact polynomial interpolant of 40 equidistant points
# is subject to the "horrible" Runge phenomenon.
# 
# Another basis is the harmonic (sine/cosine) functions. Advantages:
#  - will be orthogonal when evaluated on 40 discrete equidistant points.
#  - the domain of Lorenz95 is periodic: as are sine/cosine.
#  - (conjecture) in the 2^n dim. case, it yields a matrix of +/- 1's.
#  - nice "spectral/frequency" interpretation of each observation.
# Disadvatages:
#  - 40 is not 2^n for any n
#  - Too obvious (not very original).
#
# In conclusion, we will use the harmonic functions.
#
# 
# Update: It appears that we were wrong concerning the 2^n case.
# That is, sine/cosine functions do not yield only +/- 1's for n>2
# The question then remains (to be proven combinatorically?)
# if the +/- 1 matrices exist for dim>4
# Furthermore, experiments do not seem to indicate that I can push
# Ny much lower than for the case H = Identity,
# even though the rmse is a lot lower with spectral H.
# Am I missing something?
