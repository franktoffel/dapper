## Expected rmse_a = 0.3
# config = EnKF('PertObs',N=30,infl=3.2)
# Note that infl=1 may yield approx optimal rmse, even though then rmv << rmse.
# Why is rmse so INsensitive to inflation, especially for PertObs?

# Reproduce raanes'2015 "extending sqrt method to model noise":
# config = EnKF('Sqrt',fnoise_treatm='XXX',N=30,infl=1.0),
# where XXX is one of:
# - Stoch
# - Mult-1
# - Mult-M
# - Sqrt-Core
# - Sqrt-Add-Z
# - Sqrt-Dep

# Other notes:
# - Multidim. multiplicative noise incorporation
#   has a tendency to go awry.
#   The main reason is that it changes the ensemble subspace,
#   away from the "model" subspace.
# - There are also some very strong, regular correlation
#   patters that arise when dt=1 (dt = c*dx).
# - It also happens if X0pat does not use centering.
