# "Linear advection"  model.
# Optimal solution provided by Kalman filter (ExtKF).
# System is typically used with a relatively large size (Nx=1000),
# but initialized with a moderate wavenumber (k),
# which a DA method should hopefully be able to exploit.
# 
# A summary for the purpose of DA is provided in section 3.3
